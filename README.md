# EventSystemBasedUIManager
 Unity Event System based UI Manager
 
 To use UI Manager Events: 
 
 -Add a reference for UIEventsSO (Scriptable Object)
 -Invoke methods from UIEventsSO like UIEventsSO.EnableGameplayUIEvent.Invoke();
 
 Developer's advice: If you will try to use this Manager without any modification make sure your scene setup looks like the SampleScene.
 
 To test the system on SampleScene: 
 
 "-Press D to enable, C to disable pause screen UI

-Press F to enable, V to disable GameplayUI

-Press G to enable win UI, B to enable lose UI"

PS: Feel free to use or modify as long as you mention the developer :).
